# Vue Dynamic List of Posts

Implement the App with ability to show posts of a current logged-in user.
The user should be able to create a new post with their userId. Each post can
be opened in the sidebar with its comments, can be edited and deleted. There should delete a comment and a
form to add new comments.

> Here is [the working version](https://mate-academy.github.io/vue_dynamic-list-of-posts/#/)

1. Learn the `.html` files to get all needed layouts;
1. Initially the `App` shows the `Posts table` and `Create new post` button

   - show the `<Loader>` while waiting for the API response;
   - show an error notification if `posts` loading fails;
   - if the user has no posts show the `No posts yet` notification.

1. Add the `Sidebar--open` class to the sidebar when user click on `Create new post`;

   - the form for new post should be appear there immediately;
   - add validation to the fields;
   - when user click on `Create` component with post details and comments should be appear there immediately ;

1. In the `Post preview` user should see `edit` and `delete` buttons;

   - When user click on `Delete`, post should be deleted and sidebar close;
   - When user click on `Edit` show edit post form;
   - When user click on `Save` in edit mode - show post preview in the sidebar;

1. Add the `Sidebar--open` class to the sidebar when a post is selected;
   - the post details should appear there immediately;
   - the post commnets should be loaded from the API;
   - the `Loader` is shown before comments are loaded;
   - `CommentsError` notification is show on loading error;
   - `NoComments` message is shown if the post does not have comments yet;
1. Show the `Write a comment` button below the comments
   - after click hide the button and show the form to add new comment;
   - the form stays visible until the other post is opened;
   - the form should be implemented as a separate component;
1. The form requires an author's name and email and a comment text.
   - show errors only after the form is submitted;
   - remove an error on the field change;
   - keep the `name` and `email` after the successful submit but clear a comment text;
   - The `Clear` button should also clear all errors;
   - Add the `is-loading` class to the submit button while waiting for a response;
   - Add the new comment received as a response from the `API` to the end of the list;
1. Implement comment deletion
   - Delete the commnet immediately not waiting for the server response to improve the UX.
1. (\*) Handle `Add` and `Delete` errors so the user can retry
